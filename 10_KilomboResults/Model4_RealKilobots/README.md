# Model 4: Bees model in kilombo imitating real kilobots conditions.

1. Exploration times ($\Delta t$) and dancing times measured in loops, not ticks.
2. Dancing times proportional to exploration times.
3. Random walk with 120 ticks straight and discrete angles during 90 and 180 ticks, both with equal probability and same for left and right.
